# Germany Hörverstehen Exam Practice App

## Overview

This is an application designed to help students prepare for the **Germany Hörverstehen Exam**. Instead of using traditional paper to test yourself, this app provides a digital solution that mirrors the format of the actual exam, which is also conducted on a laptop. While writing is always a great way to learn, this app offers a convenient way to test your listening comprehension in a realistic exam-like environment.

## Features

- **Multiple Exam Support**: The app includes 25 different Hörverstehen exams, each with three sections (Teil 1, Teil 2, and Teil 3).
- **Automated Feedback**: Instantly see which answers are correct (marked in green) and which are wrong (marked in red) after submitting your answers.
- **Progression System**: After finishing each Teil, you can move on to the next one or start a new exam when you’ve completed all sections.
- **End-of-Exam Summary**: After completing all three parts of the exam, you can choose to go to the next exam or finish your practice session.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the app**: Open the app from your system.
2. **Select an exam**: Choose any of the 25 available exams.
3. **Answer questions**: For each Teil (section), read the question and select "Richtig" or "Falsch."
4. **Submit answers**: After completing a section, submit your answers and view the feedback.
5. **Continue**: After finishing Teil 1, Teil 2, and Teil 3, you can proceed to the next exam or finish the session.
